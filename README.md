# Me :
Hi there, I'm Baptiste Duvieu, a french junior developer and this is my very own github 😁 <br><br>

On this profile, you will find lots of different projects (most of them are side projects), from low-level programming (ASM, C) to web developement (PHP) passing by some machine learning projects in Python or graphic 💥 <br><br>

In short, enjoy my work, enjoy these repositories ✨
